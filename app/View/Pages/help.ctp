Please choose the appropriate answer for yourself.</br>

Clever : if you are clever enough, you will not need our directions to tell you how to become a member. You probably a member right now and you are just reading this for fun.</br>

Normal : Just click “Register now” link on the blue card at the top right corner of home page or the lock icon on the right top korner of toork bar.</br>

Stupid : On the home page of toork you will see a lock icon where will lead you to become a member after you click it. Click “Register Now” link and fill in the form with your real informations. Because we will be sending you a confirmation email to verify you. Otherwise you will not be able to log in to the system.</br>

                      <h1>Add to Favorites</h1>
                      <p>

One of the first things you will notice about Toork is Favorite button at the right bottom corner of each game you play. This is a button shaped like a heart. Do not affraid, just click it.

You can simply add games to your channels having regards of the terms and conditions. Do not forget that you have your own game channel on toork and you are responsible from your channel so be aware of the illegal actions and stay away from them. You will be able to add any game which is shared on the web but make sure that the game you are adding to your channel is legal and licenced to web site you are taking it from and that web site is letting you have it. Most game sites have sections like “games for webmasters” , “free web site games” where they give the “embed code”. This is our keyword and this is the only way we let you add games to your site. Embed codes can be in various ways like the tags embed, iframe, object. Toork does accept all these types. Now we know that we need an embed code for the game to add it to our channel. So what else do we need to know to add a new game to our channel;

Clever: you already figured out how to do that so stop wasting my time.</br>

Normal: Click on the  “+ Add Game” button on your channel card and fill in the form</br>

Stupid: Go to your channel and click on the “+ Add Game” link on your blue channel card on the left top corner. Fill in the form that appears and you will need 2 types of pictures for your games. One is for you game icon and the other is the slider picture. These 2 pictures need to be the exact size as wanted.</br>
